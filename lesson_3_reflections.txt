Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

A: I believe a remote repository works great as a backup and to collaborate 
with other people.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: It would probably be good to always have the control of when i push to 
and pull from Git. It would ensure consistency in my work.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of another?

A: A branch is a form of organizing commits inside one repository. A clone is
a copy of a repository. A fork is a special kind of clone within GitHub that,
among other things, lets one give credit to the original author of a project.
