Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: I believe a remote repository works great as a backup and to collaborate with other people.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: It would probably be good to always have the control of when i push to and pull
from Git. It would ensure consistency in my work.
