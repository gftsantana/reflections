What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

We need to initialize the repository to tell git that it needs to start tracking
the repository. When we do that, git creates hidden directories where it will
add its files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
 
The staging area is where we put the files we are tracking in the next commit.
It is extremely valuable because it allows us to track only what makes sense in
a commit.
